      <h3>Week 2 Reflection</h3>

      <article class="journal-question">
        <h4>1️⃣ How did you approach mobile-first design?</h4>
        <p>
          My first step was to plan for smaller screens rather than starting with the desktop layout.
          I created the base structure in HTML and wrote CSS that worked well on a mobile display without any media queries.
          After confirming everything looked balanced and readable, I gradually added breakpoints for tablets and laptops.
          Each new rule was added only when the design required extra space or a layout adjustment.
          This way, the site adapted naturally and stayed clean on every screen size.

      <article class="journal-question">
        <h4>2️⃣ What was the most useful HTML or CSS concept you applied this week?</h4>
        <p>
          The concepts I found most valuable were <strong>Flexbox</strong> for alignment and <strong>responsive units</strong> such as
          <code>rem</code> and <code>%</code>. Flexbox helped organize the header and navigation, while flexible sizing made
          the sections scale smoothly. I also learned how helpful it is to separate content structure from presentation —
          keeping the HTML semantic and letting CSS handle all the visual styling. This improved the site’s accessibility and maintainability.

      <article class="journal-question">
        <h4>3️⃣ What part of HTML or CSS did you find most challenging or confusing?</h4>
        <p>
          I initially struggled with combining multiple media queries and understanding which rules took priority.
          When testing different screen widths, some styles didn’t behave as expected.
          I resolved this by experimenting step-by-step in the browser dev tools, checking which selectors were active at each size.
          Through that trial and error, I gained a clearer sense of how cascading and inheritance work in responsive design.
